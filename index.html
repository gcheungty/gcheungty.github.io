### About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science at Duke University. 

I study dictators, the strategies and tactics that authoritarian leaders use to consolidate power. I tackle these questions using a mix of qualitative archival work to build theories, and empirical data covering over 300 dictators. 

You can hire me! See my CV. 


<!--// My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in International Studies Quarterly, Conflict Management and Peace Science, Political Science Research and Methods, and PS: Political Science & Politics, among other outlets. This research explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of institutions in international relations. I have teaching experience in both quantitative methodology and international relations -->
