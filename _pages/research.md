My research focuses on authoritarian politics, aiming to understand the conditions and institutions that enable dictatorships to flourish and grow more centralized. I take an institutional approach to comparative authoritarianism, and have a regional specialty in the Middle East. 

## Trajectories of Consolidation

My book project, focuses on the strategies dictators employ to accumulate personal power. I develop a theoretical framework of leaders' strategy space that draws from qualitative cases across the Middle East and Southeast Asia. To support this framework, I model these strategies as states using a Markov chain model to assess how dictators' strategies evolve in response to the strength of elite constraints. 

### Working Papers

1. The costs of collective action: an experimental study of risk, punishment, and immunity [Revise and Resubmit]
2. Youth Wings as a Source of Authoritarian Party
Strength 
3. Why Complete Voting Tallies Are Sometimes Not Published



### Works in Progress

<!--My other main research agenda is in evaluating authoritarian institutions and their variability over time. I develop indicators such as the existence of youth wings in political parties and the transparency in vote tally publication to gauge the evolving strength or vulnerability of authoritarian regimes. I currently have a co-authored article under revise and resubmit at the \textit{Journal of Politics}, which presents a formal model of collective action with punishment and immunity, and tests it in an laboratory setting.-->

<!-- My academic research falls into two main areas: understanding the influence of geography on actor behavior before, during, and after civil conflict, and developing new tools to improve the study of institutions (both formal and informal) in peace and conflict. One strand of research in this first area explores how the territories that ethnic groups inhabit shape rebel group formation and condition their relationship with the state. My interest in geography also informs projects on active conflicts including the targeting of UN peacekeepers by insurgent groups, civilian victimization after rebel territorial conquest, and communal violence in fragile settings.

My other main research agenda uses advanced methods to develop new measures of institutions. One project uses Bayesian item response theory to measure the strength of peace agreements as a latent variable and free researchers from post-treatment bias caused by using the duration of agreements as a proxy for their strength. In others, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to over a billion observations of product-level international trade data to measure economic interdependence and illicit economic exchange.

In a new avenue of research, I leverage social media data to explore participation in extremist movements across multiple contexts, gaining insight into the early stages of radicalization.-->
