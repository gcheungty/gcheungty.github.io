I have teaching assistant in undergraduate classes on game theory, and computational modelling in social sciences. I've also been the head teaching assistant for the intro to methods and R coding for the Ralphe Bunche Summer Institute (RBSI) - an annual, intensive five-week program held at Duke University for undergraduates from under-represented raciall and ethnic groups [(more info on RBSI here)](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/How-to-Apply).

A selection of my teaching materials, including all the labs from RBSI are available on my github.

Teaching
Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the Political Science Department’s Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social sciences. I am also a certified instructor with The Carpentries, which develops evidence-based methods for teaching “essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.”
